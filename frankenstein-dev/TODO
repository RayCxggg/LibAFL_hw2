Frankenstein:
    Add csv symbol import to WebUI and CLI

    IDA import:
        - Works ok-ish with symbols
        - Segments seems to be buggy

    Extract debuginfo from ELF
        - Some vendors provide this
        - Create HDR file with signatures structs etc.

    Add symbol types to final ELF
        - Would allow re-import to IDA
        - patch_symbols.py already exists but is slow

    Make CLI more complete
        - Provide same functionality as WebUI
        - Remove manage.py


    Link firmware as .so and load it via dlopen
        Pros:
            - We can use libc and other libraries
            - We can use argv
            - Less compile time

        Questions:
            - Do we have -ldl with arm-none-eabi?
            - Evaluate Cons


Bluetooth firmware:
    Track down invocation of uart_ReceiveDMADoneInterrupt !!!

    Merge code for CYW20735B1 and CYW20819A1
        - Remove all hardcoded addresses!


    BCM4375B1
        - Write heap docu
        - Execute the snapshot
